Structure:
Enter - i. STL semantics

Choose b/w - i. Single Agent
            ii. Multi Agent
           iii. Decomposition

Return Item - i. Robust Spatiotemporal Tubes

Know before running:
Dimension - 1D for x vs t                       (2 tubes)
            2D for x vs t and y vs t            (4 tubes)
            3D for x vs t and y vs t and z vs t (6 tubes)

Tube Thickness Lower Limit - 0.5
               Upper Limit - User Input

1D Output - i. x vs t
2D Output - i. x vs t
           ii. y vs t
          iii. x vs y
           iv. x vs y vs t

Decomposition:
              i. Obstacle must have integer level discretization
             ii.
